# Vse Bude üá∫üá¶

As an online auction platform, ‚ÄúVse-bude‚Äù provides a simple and secure environment for anyone who wants to both support Ukraine and sell an item which they no longer find a need in and hand it over to new potential owners via the auction bidding system. The funds that will be raised during those auctions will be donated to one of Ukraine's accredited charity organisations/funds and the item will be delivered to its new owner.

- [Redux/Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - toolset for efficient Redux development

### Shared

- [Joi](https://github.com/sideway/joi) - schema description language and data validator for JS

## Code quality

We have certain [quality criteria](https://github.com/BinaryStudioAcademy/quality-criteria/blob/production/source/javascript.md), which we should follow during application development.

# Git flow

### Commits

Commit message **must** have next structure:

```
<project-prefix>-<task #>: <description>
```

- `task #` - Trello task number
- `description` - a short summary of code changes

Examples:

- `VB-15: add private routes`
- `VB-9: change button-styles`
- `VB-32: fix user profile avatar`

### Branches

In this project we follow with [Pull Request process](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). Two main branches (`main` and `release`) are protected with [Github branch protection rules](https://help.github.com/en/articles/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests):

- Require pull request with 1 review from code owner before merging
- Require all ci checks

Normal flow is to create a new branch for each task or group of linked tasks. Name of branch **must** have next structure:

```
<prefix>/<description>
```

- `prefix` - allowed prefixes: `feature`, `fix`.
- `description` - a short summary of the task

Examples:

- `feature/add-private-routes`
- `fix/adjust-button-styles`

After task is completed ‚Äï create PR of your branch into `main` and assign other developers to review.
